<h4>An Ideal Husband</h4>
<h5>The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square</h5>
<h6><p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?

LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?
        
MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
        
LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
go anywhere.
        
MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.
        
LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!
        
MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.
        
LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.
        
MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!
        
LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?
        
MRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.
        
LADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?
MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.

LADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!

MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!

[_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]

MASON.  [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and
Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.

[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a
portrait by Lawrence_.]</p></h6>
